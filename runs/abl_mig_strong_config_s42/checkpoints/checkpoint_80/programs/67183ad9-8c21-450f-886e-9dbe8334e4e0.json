Remove redundant comments that state the obvious (the code already clearly shows random initialization and search)\n2. Simplify `size=2` to just `2` in the numpy uniform calls since the third parameter is explicitly the size argument\n3. Reduce visual clutter while maintaining the exact same functionality and performance characteristics\n\nThe algorithm remains identical in behavior, but the code becomes more concise and focused on the essential logic rather than redundant explanations. This improves maintainability while preserving all the strong performance metrics of the original implementation."]}}}
