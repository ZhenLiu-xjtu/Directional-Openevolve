Unpacks the bounds tuple into `low` and `high` variables for clearer code referencing\n2. Removes redundant comments that restated what the code already shows clearly\n3. Maintains the exact same algorithm behavior and performance characteristics\n4. Improves readability by eliminating magic indices (bounds[0], bounds[1])\n5. Reduces cognitive load when reading the code by using descriptive variable names\n\nThe algorithm's random search behavior remains identical, so all performance metrics should stay at their current excellent levels while the code becomes more maintainable and easier to understand."]}}}
