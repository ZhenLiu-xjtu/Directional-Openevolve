Combining the generation of x and y coordinates into single lines using numpy's uniform with size=2, reducing redundancy\n2. Using more descriptive variable names like \"best_point\" to clarify that these values belong together\n3. Reducing the number of lines while maintaining the same functionality\n4. Making the code flow better by grouping related operations\n\nThe algorithm remains functionally identical but becomes more readable and maintainable. The changes maintain all the existing performance metrics while addressing the key improvement area of simplification.\n</think>Okay, let's see. The user wants me to improve the current program by simplifying the code to enhance readability and maintainability, as per the areas identified for improvement. The current code is a random search algorithm for function minimization. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the current code structure. The search_algorithm function initializes best_x and best_y separately with np.random.uniform. Maybe combining those two lines into a single array could make it cleaner. Like using np.random.uniform once and unpacking into x and y. That would reduce redundancy and make the code shorter.\n\nThen, inside the loop, they generate x and y the same way. Again, maybe generating them together as a pair would simplify things. Also, using a tuple assignment might make the code more concise.\n\nWait, looking at the code: best_x and best_y are each assigned with np.random.uniform. So instead of two separate calls, we can generate a 2-element array and unpack it. So something like best_point = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2), then best_x, best_y = best_point. That would save a line and make the initialization more compact.\n\nSame for the loop: x and y are generated separately. Changing that to a single uniform call with size=2 would make it cleaner. So x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2). That would replace two lines with one, making the code more readable.\n\nAnother thing: the evaluate_function is called with best_x and best_y. If we have a best_point array, we could pass *best_point to unpack it, but maybe that's not necessary. Let me check. The initial code uses evaluate_function(best_x, best_y), which is fine. But if we have best_point as an array, then evaluate_function(*best_point) would work. But maybe that's a minor change.\n\nSo the main simplifications would be combining the generation of x and y in both the initialization and the loop. That reduces the number of lines and makes the code less repetitive.\n\nLet me check the original code again. The initial lines are:\n\nbest_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\nbest_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n\nWe can replace these with:\n\nbest_point = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\nbest_x, best_y = best_point\n\nSimilarly, inside the loop:\n\nx = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\ny = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n\nBecomes:\n\npoint = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\nx, y = point\n\nThis would make the code more concise. Also, using variables like 'point' instead of separate x and y might make the code flow better, showing that x and y are part of a single point in the search space.\n\nThese changes would simplify the code by reducing redundant calls to np.random.uniform and making the code more compact.
