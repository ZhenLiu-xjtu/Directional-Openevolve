By generating x and y coordinates with separate calls to `np.random.uniform`, we create more independent sampling which appears to help the algorithm find better minima (higher value_score) and explore the space more effectively (higher distance_score and standard_deviation_score).\n\nThis change maintains the algorithm's simplicity while restoring the performance levels seen in Program 1, which had the highest combined_score (0.9340) across all evaluated programs."]}}}
