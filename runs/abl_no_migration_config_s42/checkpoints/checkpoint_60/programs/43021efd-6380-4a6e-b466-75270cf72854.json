Remove unnecessary intermediate `best_point` variable by directly unpacking the random values into best_x and best_y\n2. Remove unnecessary intermediate `point` variable by directly unpacking the random values into x and y\n3. Simplify comments to be more concise while maintaining clarity\n\nThe algorithm logic remains identical, but the code becomes more streamlined and readable by eliminating redundant variables. This improves maintainability while preserving all the existing performance metrics since we haven't changed any of the algorithm's behavior."]}}}
