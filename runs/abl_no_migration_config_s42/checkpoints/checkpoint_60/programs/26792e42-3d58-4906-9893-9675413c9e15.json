The top-performing Program 1 used an adaptive search strategy that combined global exploration with local refinement, which likely contributed to its superior performance.\n\n## 1. Add Adaptive Local Search\n\nReintroduce the adaptive local search strategy from Program 1 that occasionally explores around the current best solution:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Simple random search\n        # Generate new point with combined random sampling\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value = value\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n=======\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Adaptive search: sometimes explore locally around best solution\n        if _ > 0 and np.random.random() < 0.3:  # 30% chance of local search\n            # Take small steps from current best with decreasing step size\n            step_size = 0.1 * (1 - _/iterations)\n            x = best_x + np.random.normal(0, step_size)\n            y = best_y + np.random.normal(0, step_size)\n            # Keep within bounds\n            x = np.clip(x, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n            y = np.clip(y, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        else:\n            # Generate candidate solution with global search\n            x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n            \n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value = value\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n## 2. Simplify Initialization\n\nWhile keeping the vectorized initialization, remove redundant comment for cleaner code:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    # Generate initial point with combined random sampling\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n=======\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n## Reasoning\n\nThe key improvement is reintroducing the adaptive search strategy that:\n1. Performs global exploration (random uniform sampling) most of the time\n2. Occasionally (30% chance) performs local refinement around the current best solution\n3. Uses a decreasing step size for local search, allowing more focused exploration as iterations progress\n\nThis hybrid approach should improve:\n- **distance_score**: By systematically exploring around promising solutions\n- **standard_deviation_score**: By reducing variability in results through more consistent local refinement\n- **overall_score**: Through better balance of exploration and exploitation\n\nThe changes maintain the code's readability while significantly enhancing the search algorithm's effectiveness, bringing it closer to the performance of Program 1 which achieved a combined_score of 0.9994."]}}}
