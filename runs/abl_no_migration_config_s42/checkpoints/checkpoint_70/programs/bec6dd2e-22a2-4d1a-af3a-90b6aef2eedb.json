Add Simple Local Search to Improve Value Score\n\nThe current random search algorithm often gets stuck in local minima. Adding a simple local search component will help explore the area around good solutions, potentially improving the value_score which has regressed slightly.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Generate candidate solution with vectorized operation\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value = value\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n=======\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Adaptive search: sometimes explore locally around best solution\n        if _ > 0 and np.random.random() < 0.3:  # 30% chance of local search\n            # Take small steps from current best\n            step_size = 0.1 * (1 - _/iterations)  # Decreasing step size\n            x = best_x + np.random.normal(0, step_size)\n            y = best_y + np.random.normal(0, step_size)\n            # Keep within bounds\n            x = np.clip(x, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n            y = np.clip(y, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        else:\n            # Generate candidate solution with vectorized operation\n            x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n            \n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value = value\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n## 2. Simplify Variable Initialization\n\nWhile vectorized operations are efficient, using separate lines for x and y initialization improves readability while maintaining the same functionality.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with a random point using vectorized generation\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n=======\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    best_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n## Reasoning\n\n1. The local search addition creates a hybrid algorithm that:\n   - Maintains the simplicity of random search\n   - Adds directed exploration around promising solutions\n   - Uses a decreasing step size to balance exploration/exploitation\n   - Should help escape local minima, improving value_score\n\n2. The simplified initialization:\n   - Improves readability as requested in the improvement areas\n   - Matches the style of Program 2 which had higher value_score\n   - Removes unnecessary complexity without performance impact\n\nThese changes are targeted, maintain the original algorithm's simplicity, and address both the value_score regression and the readability improvement request."]}}}
