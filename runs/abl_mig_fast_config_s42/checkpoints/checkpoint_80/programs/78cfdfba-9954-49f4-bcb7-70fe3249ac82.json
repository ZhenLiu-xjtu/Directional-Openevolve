Removing unnecessary intermediate variables (`best_point` and `point`)\n2. Directly unpacking the random values into coordinate variables\n3. Reducing line count while maintaining the same functionality\n\nThe changes improve readability by making the code more concise and eliminating redundant variables that don't add clarity. The algorithm's behavior remains identical since we're still generating the same random points and performing the same comparison logic - we've just removed unnecessary variable assignments that create mental overhead.\n\nThis maintains all the strong performance metrics while addressing the maintainability improvement area by making the code more straightforward and easier to follow."]}}}
