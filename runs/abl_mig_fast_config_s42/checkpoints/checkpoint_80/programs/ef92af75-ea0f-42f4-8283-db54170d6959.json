The new comments are more descriptive while keeping the code clean and maintainable.\n\n2. **Adaptive Search Strategy**: The modified search algorithm maintains most of the original random search behavior (80% of iterations) while adding a local exploration component (20% of iterations). This:\n   - Helps escape local minima by exploring around promising solutions\n   - Maintains good coverage of the search space through global exploration\n   - Adds minimal computational overhead\n   - Should improve value_score and distance_score by finding better minima\n   - Uses a simple implementation that maintains code readability\n\nThese changes follow the pattern of previous successful improvements while specifically addressing the readability concern and potentially enhancing optimization performance through a more intelligent search strategy."]}}}
