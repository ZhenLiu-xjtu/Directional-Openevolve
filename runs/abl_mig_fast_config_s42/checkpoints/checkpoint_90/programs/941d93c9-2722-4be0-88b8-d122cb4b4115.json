Unpack Bounds for Clarity\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with a random point (simplified)\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], 2)\n=======\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    min_bound, max_bound = bounds\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(min_bound, max_bound, size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n## 2. Consistent Random Generation\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Simple random search (simplified)\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], 2)\n=======\n        # Generate new random candidate point\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(min_bound, max_bound, size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n## Reasoning\n\n1. **Unpacking Bounds**: By unpacking the bounds tuple into `min_bound` and `max_bound` variables, we make the code more readable and avoid magic index access (`bounds[0]` and `bounds[1]`). This clarifies which value is being used where.\n\n2. **Explicit Size Parameter**: Using `size=2` instead of just `2` in `np.random.uniform()` makes the code more self-documenting and follows NumPy best practices.\n\n3. **Improved Comments**: The updated comments are more descriptive about what each section actually does without being redundant with the docstring.\n\nThese changes maintain the algorithm's functionality and performance while making the code more maintainable and easier to understand for future developers. The core random search algorithm remains intact, so we expect all performance metrics to stay at their current excellent levels."]}}}
