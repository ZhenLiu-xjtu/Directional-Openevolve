Improved docstring:\n   - Removed negative self-criticism about getting stuck in local minima\n   - Added default values to parameter documentation for clarity\n   - Made language more concise and professional\n\n2. Simplified random number generation:\n   - Used `*bounds` to unpack the tuple, making the code cleaner and more readable\n   - Removed redundant `bounds[0], bounds[1]` references\n\n3. Improved comments:\n   - Made comments more concise while maintaining clarity\n   - Created consistency between initialization and iteration comments\n\nThese changes enhance readability and maintainability by reducing redundancy and improving documentation, while keeping the core algorithm intact. The simplified `np.random.uniform(*bounds, size=2)` is easier to read and less error-prone than the original version."]}}}
