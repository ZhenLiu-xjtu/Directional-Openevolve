Reduce code redundancy by combining separate random number generation calls into single lines\n2. Improve readability by making the coordinate generation more explicit as pairs\n3. Maintain identical functionality and performance characteristics\n4. Keep the same random distribution properties since we're still using the same uniform distribution parameters\n\nThe algorithm's behavior remains unchanged, but the code becomes more concise and easier to maintain while keeping the same performance metrics."]}}}
