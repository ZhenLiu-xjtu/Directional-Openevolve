Includes bounds clipping to ensure we stay within the valid search space\n\nThe key advantages are:\n- Improves distance_score by helping escape local minima through strategic exploration\n- Maintains speed_score with minimal computational overhead\n- Preserves readability through clear separation of exploration/exploitation phases\n- Enhances combined_score by balancing global and local search\n\nThe exploration ratio (starting at 1.0 and decreasing to 0) ensures we:\n- Thoroughly explore the search space initially\n- Focus increasingly on refining promising solutions\n- Use appropriate search widths that scale with remaining iterations\n\nThis adaptive approach addresses the core limitation of pure random search (getting stuck in local minima) while maintaining the algorithm's simplicity and speed."]}}}
