Simplified the docstring by removing the unnecessary comment about getting stuck in local minima, making the description more concise while maintaining all essential information.\n\n2. Used tuple unpacking with `*bounds` in the np.random.uniform call, which makes the code cleaner and more readable while maintaining the exact same functionality. This removes the need to explicitly reference bounds[0] and bounds[1].\n\nThese changes improve readability and maintainability without altering the algorithm's behavior or performance characteristics, which should help maintain the excellent performance metrics while making the code easier to understand and modify in the future."]}}}
