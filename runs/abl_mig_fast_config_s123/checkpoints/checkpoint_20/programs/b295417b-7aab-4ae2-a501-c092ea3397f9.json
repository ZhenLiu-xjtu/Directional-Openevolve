Using vectorized operations to generate (x,y) points in a single line instead of two separate calls to np.random.uniform\n2. Adding clearer comments that explain the purpose of each section\n3. Reducing code duplication by handling x and y coordinates together\n4. Making the code more concise while maintaining the same functionality\n\nThe algorithm's behavior remains identical - we're still performing random search with the same distribution and bounds. However, the code is now more compact and easier to understand at a glance, which improves maintainability. The vectorized approach also has the benefit of being slightly more efficient in terms of numpy operations.\n```"]}}}
