Implements bounded local search around promising points using normal distribution\n5. Keeps all original good performance metrics intact while potentially improving:\n   - distance_score: by finding minima closer to the true optimal value\n   - value_score: by potentially finding better (lower) function values\n   - standard_deviation_score: by producing more consistent results\n\nThe algorithm remains easy to understand and maintain while becoming more effective at finding good minima through the balanced exploration/exploitation approach."]}}}
