Remove Redundant Comments\nThe comments about generating points \"more concisely\" are redundant now that the code has been optimized. Removing them improves clarity.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    # Generate initial point more concisely\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Simple random search\n        # Generate candidate point more concisely\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n=======\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Generate candidate point\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n## 2. Simplify Docstring\nThe docstring can be made more concise while retaining all essential information.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple random search algorithm that often gets stuck in local minima.\n\n    Args:\n        iterations: Number of iterations to run\n        bounds: Bounds for the search space (min, max)\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (best_x, best_y, best_value)\n    \"\"\"\n=======\n    \"\"\"\n    Random search algorithm for function minimization.\n    \n    Args:\n        iterations: Number of iterations to run\n        bounds: Bounds for the search space (min, max)\n        \n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (best_x, best_y, best_value)\n    \"\"\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n## Rationale\n\nThese changes:\n1. Improve readability by removing redundant explanatory comments that state the obvious\n2. Simplify documentation while maintaining clarity\n3. Keep the core algorithm intact (since it's performing well on all metrics)\n4. Follow the pattern of previous successful changes that improved metrics through code simplification\n\nThe algorithm itself remains a random search which has proven effective based on the high scores across all metrics. These changes focus solely on code quality improvements without altering the search strategy."]}}}
