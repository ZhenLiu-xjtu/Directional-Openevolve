The top-performing programs all used a simpler approach that gradually narrows the search radius around promising areas.\n\n1. **Simplified Algorithm**: Removed the exploration_rate parameter and the conditional check that decided between global exploration and local refinement. This simplifies the code flow and matches the approach of the top-performing programs.\n\n2. **Consistent Naming**: Changed \"step_size\" back to \"radius\" to match the terminology of the high-performing programs, improving readability and consistency.\n\n3. **Focused Search Strategy**: Returned to the proven approach of continuously refining the search around the best found point rather than periodically jumping to random locations, which should improve:\n   - value_score (by consistently moving toward minima)\n   - distance_score (by maintaining focus on promising regions)\n   - standard_deviation_score (by producing more consistent results)\n\nThese changes directly address the identified need for simplification while reverting to the core algorithm structure that produced superior metrics in previous attempts. The simplified approach should be more maintainable while improving the regression metrics."]}}}
