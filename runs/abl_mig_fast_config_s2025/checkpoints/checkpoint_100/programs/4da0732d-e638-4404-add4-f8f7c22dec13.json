Remove the exploration/exploitation balance that was likely causing instability and poor convergence (lower distance_score and higher standard deviation)\n2. Revert to the simpler, more effective radius-based approach from the top-performing programs\n3. Simplify the code as recommended in the improvement areas\n4. Maintain the adaptive search behavior but in a more focused way\n\nThe hybrid exploration approach was likely causing the algorithm to jump around too much rather than focusing on promising regions, which explains the lower distance_score and higher standard deviation. The simpler radius-reduction approach from the top-performing programs consistently delivered better results across all metrics."]}}}
