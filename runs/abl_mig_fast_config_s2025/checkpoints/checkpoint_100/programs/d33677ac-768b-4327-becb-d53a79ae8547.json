Removing the exploration/exploitation branching logic which was likely causing inconsistent performance (lower standard_deviation_score)\n2. Returning to the proven adaptive radius approach from the top-performing programs\n3. Maintaining the adaptive step size mechanism that gradually focuses the search\n4. Keeping the code more concise while preserving readability\n\nThese changes should improve:\n- distance_score by consistently focusing on promising regions\n- standard_deviation_score by removing the random exploration element that causes variability\n- overall_score and combined_score through more stable and effective searching\n\nThe simplified approach matches the structure of Program 1 and Program 2 which had significantly higher performance metrics across all categories."]}}}
