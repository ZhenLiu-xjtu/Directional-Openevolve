This:\n1. Reduces code duplication by eliminating the second call to `np.random.uniform`\n2. Makes the code more concise and readable\n3. Maintains the exact same functionality and performance characteristics\n4. Improves maintainability by having coordinate generation follow the same pattern throughout the function\n\nThe change is purely stylistic while maintaining the algorithm's behavior, which aligns with the goal of improving readability and maintainability without affecting the existing performance metrics."]}}}
