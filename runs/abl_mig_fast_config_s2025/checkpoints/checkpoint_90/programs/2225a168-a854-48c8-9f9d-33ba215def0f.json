Removing the intermediate `best_point` and `point` array variables\n2. Working directly with individual coordinates throughout the function\n3. Eliminating the need to unpack arrays multiple times\n4. Reducing the number of variables that need to be tracked\n\nThe simplified version is more readable while maintaining the exact same functionality. By removing unnecessary variables and operations, we improve maintainability and potentially slightly improve performance by reducing memory operations. This approach matches the structure of Program 1, which had significantly better metrics including value_score (0.9682 vs 0.9510) and distance_score (0.8630 vs 0.6283)."]}}}
