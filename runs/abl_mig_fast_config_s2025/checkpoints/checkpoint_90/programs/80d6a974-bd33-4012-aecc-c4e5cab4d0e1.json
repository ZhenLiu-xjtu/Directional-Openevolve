The explicit indexing improves clarity and avoids potential issues with tuple unpacking.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Search around best found point with current radius\n        x = np.clip(best_x + np.random.normal(0, radius), bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        y = np.clip(best_y + np.random.normal(0, radius), bounds[0], bounds[1])\n=======\n        # Balance exploration and exploitation\n        if i % 10 == 0:  # Occasional global exploration (10% of iterations)\n            x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], 2)\n        else:  # Local search around best found point with current radius\n            x = np.clip(best_x + np.random.normal(0, radius), bounds[0], bounds[1])\n            y = np.clip(best_y + np.random.normal(0, radius), bounds[0], bounds[1])\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis improvement adds occasional global exploration (10% of iterations) inspired by Inspiration 2, which helps prevent getting trapped in local minima. This should improve:\n- value_score by potentially finding better minima\n- distance_score by exploring more of the search space\n- standard_deviation_score by making the algorithm more robust across different runs\n\nThese changes maintain the original algorithm's simplicity while addressing the key performance regressions observed in the metrics. The adaptive radius mechanism is preserved, but with the addition of periodic global exploration to balance exploitation with continued exploration."]}}}
