Add Exploration Mechanism to Escape Local Minima\n\nThe current program lacks a mechanism to explore new areas after converging, which likely contributes to poor distance and value scores. Adding occasional random exploration helps find better minima.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for i in range(iterations):\n        # Adaptive search radius - starts wide, gets narrower\n        radius = initial_radius - (initial_radius - final_radius) * (i / iterations)\n        \n        # Search around best found point with current radius\n        x = np.clip(best_x + np.random.normal(0, radius), low, high)\n        y = np.clip(best_y + np.random.normal(0, radius), low, high)\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value = value\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n=======\n    for i in range(iterations):\n        # Adaptive search radius - starts wide, gets narrower\n        radius = initial_radius - (initial_radius - final_radius) * (i / iterations)\n        \n        # Mix local search with occasional exploration (10% chance)\n        if np.random.random() < 0.1:\n            # Random exploration to escape local minima\n            x, y = np.random.uniform(low, high, size=2)\n        else:\n            # Local search around best found point with current radius\n            x = np.clip(best_x + np.random.normal(0, radius), low, high)\n            y = np.clip(best_y + np.random.normal(0, radius), low, high)\n            \n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value = value\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n## 2. Simplify Bounds Handling\n\nThe current code's explicit bounds unpacking adds unnecessary complexity without benefit. Using direct tuple access improves readability and matches the approach from top-performing programs.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    low, high = bounds\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(low, high, size=2)\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n\n    # Start with wide search, then focus on promising areas\n    initial_radius = (high - low) / 2\n=======\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n\n    # Start with wide search, then focus on promising areas\n    initial_radius = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) / 2\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n## 3. Simplify Radius Calculation\n\nThe radius calculation can be simplified using linear interpolation, which improves readability and matches the approach from Inspiration 3 which had strong performance.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        radius = initial_radius - (initial_radius - final_radius) * (i / iterations)\n=======\n        # Linear interpolation from initial to final radius\n        radius = initial_radius * (1 - i/iterations) + final_radius * (i/iterations)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes address the key performance regressions by:\n1. Adding exploration to find better minima (improves value and distance scores)\n2. Simplifying code for better maintainability (addresses the identified improvement area)\n3. Maintaining the successful adaptive radius approach while making it more readable\n4. Matching patterns from the top-performing programs that previously achieved excellent scores\n\nThe combined effect should significantly improve the value_score, distance_score, overall_score, standard_deviation_score, and combined_score while maintaining the current excellent performance in runs_successfully, speed_score, reliability_score, and success_rate."]}}}
