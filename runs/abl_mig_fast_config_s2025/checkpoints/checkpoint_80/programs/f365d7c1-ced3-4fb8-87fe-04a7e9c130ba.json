This addresses the value_score and distance_score regressions by efficiently exploring the search space.\n\n2. **Focused Search Around Promising Areas**: Instead of random sampling across the entire space, we now search around the best found point with a decreasing radius. This leads to better exploitation of promising regions while maintaining exploration.\n\n3. **Simplified Type Hints**: Removed type hints to match the top performers and reduce cognitive load, improving maintainability while keeping the code clear.\n\n4. **Maintained Code Clarity**: Kept the core logic straightforward while restoring the most effective search techniques from previous high-performing versions.\n\nThese changes should restore the algorithm's ability to find better minima (improving value_score and distance_score) while maintaining consistent performance across runs (improving standard_deviation_score), ultimately leading to a higher combined_score. The adaptive approach is more efficient than pure random search, which explains its presence in all top-performing programs."]}}}
