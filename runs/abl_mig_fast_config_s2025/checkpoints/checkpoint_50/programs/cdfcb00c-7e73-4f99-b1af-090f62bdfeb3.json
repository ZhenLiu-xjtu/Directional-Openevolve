Update the docstring to reflect the improved algorithm\n2. Implement an adaptive search radius that starts wide (exploration) and gradually narrows (exploitation)\n3. Search around the best found point with a Gaussian distribution instead of pure random search\n4. Keep the code simple while significantly improving performance\n\nThis approach should:\n- Improve value_score by finding better minima\n- Improve distance_score by more consistently locating the global minimum\n- Improve standard_deviation_score by reducing variability in results\n- Maintain speed and reliability scores at 1.0000\n\nThe adaptive radius creates a natural balance between exploring new areas and refining promising solutions, which is why this approach performed so well in Program 1 (with combined_score 0.9916 vs current 0.9154)."]}}}
