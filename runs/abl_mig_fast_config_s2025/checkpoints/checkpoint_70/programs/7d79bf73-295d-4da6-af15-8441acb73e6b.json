This balances exploration (finding promising regions) and exploitation (refining within those regions).\n\n2. **Directed Randomness**: Instead of completely random points, we generate points around the best found solution using a normal distribution with the current radius. This focuses search effort where it's most likely to find improvements.\n\n3. **Bounds Protection**: The `np.clip` ensures we stay within the search bounds while allowing some random variation around our current best point.\n\nThese changes should significantly improve:\n- value_score: By finding better minima\n- distance_score: By consistently approaching the true minimum\n- standard_deviation_score: By reducing variability in results\n- overall_score and combined_score: Through the above improvements\n\nThe algorithm maintains good performance on speed and reliability while becoming more effective at finding function minima."]}}}
