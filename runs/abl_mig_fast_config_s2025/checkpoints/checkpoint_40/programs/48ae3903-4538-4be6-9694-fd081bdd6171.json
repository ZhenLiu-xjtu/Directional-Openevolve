Removed unnecessary intermediate variables (`best_point` and `candidate_point`) by directly unpacking the random values into coordinate variables\n2. Changed loop variable from `i` to `_` since we don't use the index value, which is more Pythonic\n3. Changed `2` to `size=2` in the numpy calls to make the code more explicit and readable\n4. Maintained exactly the same algorithmic behavior and performance characteristics\n\nThe simplified code is easier to follow while preserving the high performance metrics of the original implementation. The core random search algorithm remains intact, so we can expect similar or improved scores due to the enhanced readability."]}}}
