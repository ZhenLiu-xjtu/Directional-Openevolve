By starting with a wide search radius and gradually narrowing it, we:\n   - Explore broadly initially to find promising regions\n   - Focus on local refinement later\n   - Stay within bounds using np.clip()\n   - Maintain O(n) time complexity with same speed_score\n   - Improve distance_score by escaping local minima\n\n2. **Documentation Update**: The comment update:\n   - Removes the misleading \"often gets stuck\" statement\n   - Better describes the actual algorithm behavior\n   - Improves maintainability as requested in the improvement areas\n\nThese changes continue the evolutionary trajectory that previously improved metrics while keeping the code simple and maintainable. The adaptive approach should particularly improve the distance_score and value_score by finding better minima."]}}}
