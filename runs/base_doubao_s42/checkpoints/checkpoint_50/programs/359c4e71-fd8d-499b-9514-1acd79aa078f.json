Maintain the same algorithmic approach while making the code more concise\n\nThe vectorized approach keeps related variables together, potentially reducing any subtle correlation issues that might have been introduced with separate random number generation calls. This should help recover the lost performance in value_score, distance_score, and other regression metrics."]}}}
