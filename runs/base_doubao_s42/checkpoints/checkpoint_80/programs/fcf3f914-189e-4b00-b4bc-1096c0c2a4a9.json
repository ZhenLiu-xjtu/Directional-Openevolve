The duplicate comment lines were adding unnecessary clutter without providing additional information. By keeping only the more descriptive comment in each case, the code becomes cleaner and easier to maintain while preserving all existing performance characteristics.\n\nThe algorithm itself remains unchanged, so all performance metrics (success rate, speed, reliability) should stay at their current excellent levels while the code becomes more maintainable."]}}}
