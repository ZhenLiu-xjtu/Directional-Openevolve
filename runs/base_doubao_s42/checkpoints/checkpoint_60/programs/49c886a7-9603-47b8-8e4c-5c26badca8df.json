Vectorize random point generation for cleaner code and potential performance improvements\n2. Add a simple adaptive search behavior to help escape local minima\n\nHere are the specific changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    best_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n=======\n    # Initialize with a random point using vectorized operation\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis change simplifies the code by generating both coordinates in a single vectorized operation, matching the approach used in the top-performing programs.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Simple random search\n        x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value = value\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n=======\n        # Adaptive search with occasional exploration\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n        \n        # Adaptive probability to accept worse solutions early in search\n        temperature = 1.0 - (_ / iterations)\n        if value < best_value or np.random.rand() < np.exp((best_value - value) / temperature):\n            best_value = value\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThis enhancement:\n1. Uses vectorized point generation for consistency with initialization\n2. Adds simulated annealing-inspired behavior to occasionally accept worse solutions early in the search\n3. Gradually becomes more selective as the search progresses (temperature decreases)\n\nThe adaptive acceptance criteria helps the algorithm escape local minima while maintaining the simplicity and speed of the original approach. This should improve both the quality of solutions found (distance_score) and the consistency of results (standard_deviation_score), leading to higher overall and combined scores."]}}}
