Add clearer comments explaining key steps\n4. Calculate search space width once instead of repeatedly\n\nThe hybrid approach should help escape local minima while maintaining the algorithm's simplicity and speed, potentially improving value_score and distance_score while keeping the code maintainable."]}}}
