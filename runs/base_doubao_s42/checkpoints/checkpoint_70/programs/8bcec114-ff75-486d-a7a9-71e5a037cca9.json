Use more descriptive comment for the search step\n4. Maintain the exact same algorithmic behavior while making the code cleaner\n\nThe core random search functionality remains identical, so all performance metrics should stay the same while the code becomes more maintainable and easier to understand. The changes follow Python best practices for readability by reducing magic numbers and improving variable names."]}}}
