Improve Search Strategy with Exploration/Exploitation Balance\nThe current random search often gets stuck in local minima. We'll modify it to occasionally search around the current best solution while maintaining simplicity:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Simple random search\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n=======\n        # Balance exploration and exploitation\n        if np.random.random() < 0.8:  # 80% chance to exploit around current best\n            # Local search with small perturbations\n            x = np.clip(best_x + np.random.normal(0, 0.5), bounds[0], bounds[1])\n            y = np.clip(best_y + np.random.normal(0, 0.5), bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        else:  # 20% chance to explore new areas\n            # Global random search\n            x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Clarifying Comments**: The added comments from the top-performing program improve readability by explicitly stating that we're combining variable initialization for simplicity.\n\n2. **Search Strategy Improvement**: The modified search balances:\n   - **Exploitation** (80%): Searching around the current best solution with small Gaussian perturbations helps refine promising solutions\n   - **Exploration** (20%): Maintaining occasional global random search prevents getting stuck in local minima\n   - **Bounds Checking**: Using `np.clip` ensures we stay within the search bounds\n   - **Simplicity**: The logic remains easy to understand while being more effective than pure random search\n\nThis approach maintains the code's simplicity while potentially improving the value_score and distance_score by finding better minima."]}}}
