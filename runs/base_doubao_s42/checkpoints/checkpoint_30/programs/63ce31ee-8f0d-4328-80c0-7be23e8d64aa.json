Implements adaptive step size that decreases over time (from 10% of search space to near zero)\n5. Keeps solutions within bounds using clipping\n\nThe adaptive approach should help escape local minima (improving distance_score) while refining promising solutions (improving value_score). The decreasing step size focuses the search more tightly as iterations progress, which should improve standard_deviation_score by producing more consistent results.\n\nThese changes maintain the perfect speed and reliability scores while making the algorithm more effective at finding better minima."]}}}
