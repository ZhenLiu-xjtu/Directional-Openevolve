Removes the `best_point` intermediate variable that was only used temporarily\n2. Directly unpacks the random values into `best_x` and `best_y`\n3. Uses explicit variable names in the function call instead of tuple unpacking (`*best_point`)\n4. Maintains identical functionality while making the code flow more directly\n\nThe simplified code is easier to follow since we:\n- Eliminate an unnecessary variable\n- Reduce cognitive load by removing a conversion step\n- Make the data flow more linear and direct\n- Maintain consistency with the similar pattern used inside the loop\n\nThis maintains all the strong performance metrics while improving maintainability, as requested in the improvement areas."]}}}
