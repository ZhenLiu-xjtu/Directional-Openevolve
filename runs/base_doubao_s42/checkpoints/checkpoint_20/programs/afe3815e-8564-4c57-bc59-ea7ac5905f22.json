Simplify the code by combining separate x/y random initializations into single calls using numpy's vectorized operations\n2. Improve readability with clearer comments explaining the purpose of each section\n3. Maintain the exact same algorithm behavior while reducing code redundancy\n4. Make the code more concise and easier to maintain by eliminating repetitive lines\n\nThe algorithm's performance characteristics remain identical since we're using the same random search approach with the same distribution parameters.
