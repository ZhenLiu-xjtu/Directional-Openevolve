Simplified code structure by eliminating redundant variables (best_x, best_y) and using tuple unpacking\n2. Maintained the effective hybrid search strategy (global exploration + local refinement) from top-performing programs\n3. Improved readability through clearer variable names and more concise comments\n4. Reduced code length while preserving functionality that contributes to better performance metrics\n\nThe algorithm now combines global exploration (80% of iterations) with local refinement around promising solutions (20% of iterations), which should improve value_score and distance_score while maintaining good speed and reliability. The simplified code structure enhances maintainability while preserving the core logic that made top-performing programs successful."]}}}
