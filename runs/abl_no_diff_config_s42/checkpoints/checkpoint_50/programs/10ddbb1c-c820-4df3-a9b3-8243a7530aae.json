Added directed exploration: With 20% probability, we explore around the best point found so far instead of always generating completely random points. This helps escape local minima while maintaining random search's simplicity.\n\n2. Implemented adaptive exploration: The exploration range gradually narrows over time, focusing more on promising regions as we find better solutions.\n\n3. Used controlled randomness: Added Gaussian perturbations instead of only uniform random points, creating a better balance between exploration and exploitation.\n\nThese changes should improve distance_score by finding better minima and standard_deviation_score by producing more consistent results, while maintaining the perfect scores for runs_successfully, speed_score, and reliability_score."]}}}
