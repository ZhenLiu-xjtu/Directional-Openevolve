Simplify array unpacking in random point generation\n2.

Simplify the bounds handling using `*bounds` unpacking for cleaner code\n2. Add an adaptive search strategy that mostly explores around the current best solution (exploitation) while occasionally performing global exploration\n3. Maintain overall code simplicity while introducing smarter search behavior\n\nThe adaptive approach should help find better minima (improving value_score and distance_score) while maintaining the algorithm's speed and reliability. The changes are minimal and focused, preserving readability and maintainability."]}}}
