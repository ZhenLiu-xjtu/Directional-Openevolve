Keep the core algorithm identical while improving readability\n\nThe unpacking approach is more idiomatic Python and makes the code shorter while maintaining the exact same functionality and performance characteristics. This addresses the \"simplify the code to improve readability and maintainability\" area for improvement while keeping all performance metrics intact."]}}}
