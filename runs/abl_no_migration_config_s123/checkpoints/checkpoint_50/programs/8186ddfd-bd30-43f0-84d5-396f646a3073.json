Add a simple adaptive search strategy that starts with broad exploration and gradually focuses on promising areas\n3. Improve code comments for better maintainability\n4. Keep the core algorithm simple while making it more effective at finding global minima\n\nThe adaptive approach helps address the original algorithm's tendency to get stuck in local minima by:\n- Starting with wide searches across the entire domain\n- Gradually narrowing the search radius around the best found solution\n- Maintaining the simplicity and speed of the original algorithm\n\nThis should improve the value_score and distance_score metrics while keeping the code readable and maintaining the perfect speed and reliability scores."]}}}
