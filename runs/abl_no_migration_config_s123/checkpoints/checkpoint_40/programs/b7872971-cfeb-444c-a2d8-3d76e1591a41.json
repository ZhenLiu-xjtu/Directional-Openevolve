Removing unnecessary vectorization that didn't provide meaningful benefits for generating just 2 values\n2. Eliminating the need to unpack numpy arrays into separate variables\n3. Simplifying comments to focus on intent rather than implementation details\n4. Making the code flow more naturally with one variable assignment per line\n\nThe functionality remains identical while making the code easier to understand for developers who may not be as familiar with numpy's array operations. The performance impact is negligible since we're still generating the same number of random values, and the metrics already show perfect scores for speed and reliability."]}}}
