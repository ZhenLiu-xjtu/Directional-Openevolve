This hybrid approach:\n\n1. **Improves distance_score**: By exploring around promising solutions, we're more likely to find the global minimum\n2. **Maintains speed_score**: The additional computations are minimal and won't impact performance\n3. **Improves standard_deviation_score**: The algorithm will be more consistent in finding good solutions\n4. **Preserves simplicity**: The code remains easy to understand while adding valuable functionality\n\nThe normal distribution with standard deviation 0.5 allows for exploration around promising points without straying too far, and the clipping operation ensures we stay within the search bounds.\n\nThis targeted improvement addresses the lower distance and standard deviation scores while maintaining all the perfect scores (runs_successfully, speed_score, reliability_score, success_rate)."]}}}
