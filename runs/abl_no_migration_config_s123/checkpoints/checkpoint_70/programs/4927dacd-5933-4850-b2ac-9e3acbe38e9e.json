Simplifying the docstring by removing unnecessary commentary about getting stuck in local minima\n2. Removing redundant \"Simple random search\" comment that states the obvious\n3. Combining the three variable updates into a single line when a better solution is found, making the code more concise while maintaining clarity\n\nThe functionality remains identical, so all performance metrics should stay the same while the code becomes cleaner and easier to maintain. The changes are minimal and targeted specifically at the identified improvement area of simplification."]}}}
