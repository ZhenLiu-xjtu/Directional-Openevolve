Simplify the code by generating both coordinates in a single numpy call instead of two separate calls\n2. Improve readability by reducing redundant code and adding brief explanatory comments\n3. Maintain identical functionality while making the code more concise and idiomatic\n4. Reduce the chance of errors by keeping related coordinate generation together\n\nThe use of `size=2` in `np.random.uniform` generates both x and y coordinates simultaneously, which is more efficient and readable than separate calls. This addresses the \"simplifying the code\" improvement area while maintaining all the existing performance metrics since the core algorithm logic remains unchanged."]}}}
