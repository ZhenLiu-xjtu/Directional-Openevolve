Clearer, more descriptive comments improve maintainability without changing functionality.\n\n2. **Search Refinement**: By adding a small chance (10%) to search near the current best point using a normal distribution, we maintain the algorithm's speed and simplicity while potentially helping it escape local minima. This controlled exploration near promising regions could improve:\n   - distance_score: By finding points closer to the true minimum\n   - standard_deviation_score: By providing more consistent results across runs\n   - overall_score and combined_score: Through the cumulative effect of better search capabilities\n\nThe changes are minimal and targeted, preserving the original algorithm's strengths while addressing the identified areas for improvement."]}}}
