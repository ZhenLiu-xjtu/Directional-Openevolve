Reduce code redundancy by combining separate random number generation calls\n2. Improve readability by making the coordinate generation more compact and intentional\n3. Maintain exactly the same algorithmic behavior and performance characteristics\n4. Keep the same random distribution properties since we're still using uniform sampling within the bounds\n\nThe algorithm remains a pure random search but with cleaner, more maintainable code that's easier to understand at a glance. The changes don't affect any performance metrics since we're using the same random number generation approach, just in a more concise form."]}}}
