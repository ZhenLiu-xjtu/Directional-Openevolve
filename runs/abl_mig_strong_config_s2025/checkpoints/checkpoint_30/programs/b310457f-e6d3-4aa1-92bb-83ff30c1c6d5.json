Simplify variable initialization and add clarifying comments:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], 2)\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], 2)\n=======\n    # Initialize with random starting point\n    best_xy = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n    best_x, best_y = best_xy\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Generate random candidate solution\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes:\n- Add explicit `size=2` parameter for clarity in numpy calls\n- Use intermediate variable `best_xy` to make the initialization more readable\n- Add brief comments explaining key steps without being verbose\n- Remove unnecessary blank lines that create visual clutter\n- Maintain identical algorithm behavior and performance characteristics\n\nThe algorithm remains a random search method, but the code becomes slightly more self-documenting and follows more consistent numpy best practices with the explicit `size` parameter. These improvements address the \"simplify code for readability\" area while preserving all the strong performance metrics of the current program."]}}}
