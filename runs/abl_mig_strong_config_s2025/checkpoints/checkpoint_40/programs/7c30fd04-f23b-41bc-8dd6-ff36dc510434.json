Combining separate x/y coordinate generation into single lines using numpy's vectorized random sampling with `size=2`\n2. Adding clarifying comments that explain the purpose of each coordinate generation step\n3. Reducing code duplication by generating both coordinates in one operation instead of two separate calls\n\nThe simplified version maintains the exact same algorithm behavior while being more concise and readable. The changes:\n- Improve maintainability by reducing the number of lines and related operations\n- Enhance readability through better grouping of related operations\n- Keep the same performance characteristics and random sampling behavior\n- Maintain all existing functionality and performance metrics\n\nThis addresses the \"simplifying the code to improve readability and maintainability\" improvement area while preserving the algorithm's core functionality and existing performance strengths.\n```"]}}}
