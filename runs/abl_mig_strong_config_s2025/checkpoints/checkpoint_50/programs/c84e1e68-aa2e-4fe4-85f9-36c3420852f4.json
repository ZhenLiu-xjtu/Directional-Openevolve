Simplifies comments for better readability\n4. Matches the approach of Program 1 which had superior metrics across all regression areas\n\nThe explicit bounds indexing appears to help the search algorithm explore the solution space more effectively, as evidenced by Program 1's higher value_score (0.9765 vs current 0.9706), distance_score (0.8789 vs current 0.8588), and overall combined_score (0.9309 vs current 0.9184). This targeted change maintains the algorithm's simplicity while addressing the performance regressions."]}}}
