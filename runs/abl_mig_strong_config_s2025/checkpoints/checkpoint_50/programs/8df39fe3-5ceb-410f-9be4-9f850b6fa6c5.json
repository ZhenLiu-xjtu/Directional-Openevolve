Simplify Bounds Handling\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n=======\n    # Simplified bounds unpacking\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(*bounds, size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis simplifies the code by using tuple unpacking with `*bounds` instead of explicit indexing, improving readability while maintaining identical functionality.\n\n## 2. Add Directed Search Component\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n=======\n        # Hybrid search: mostly random with occasional local exploration\n        if np.random.rand() < 0.1:  # 10% chance for local search\n            # Explore around best point with fixed step size\n            step = 0.1 * (bounds[1] - bounds[0])\n            x, y = best_x + np.random.uniform(-step, step, size=2), best_y + np.random.uniform(-step, step, size=2)\n            # Ensure we stay within bounds\n            x = np.clip(x, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n            y = np.clip(y, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        else:\n            # Global random search with simplified bounds unpacking\n            x, y = np.random.uniform(*bounds, size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change:\n- Maintains the original random search approach (90% of iterations)\n- Adds directed local search around promising points (10% of iterations)\n- Uses bounds unpacking for cleaner code\n- Includes boundary checking to keep points within search space\n\nThe hybrid approach combines global exploration (random search) with local exploitation (searching around good points), which should help find better minima while maintaining the algorithm's speed and reliability.\n\nThese changes address both the code simplification goal and have potential to improve value_score and distance_score by helping the algorithm escape local minima and refine promising solutions."]}}}
