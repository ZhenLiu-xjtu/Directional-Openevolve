Add helpful comments explaining the coordinate generation approach\n\nThe key insight is that generating coordinates together in a single numpy call may produce subtly different sampling patterns compared to separate calls, which appears to help the search algorithm find better minima as evidenced by the historical performance metrics."]}}}
