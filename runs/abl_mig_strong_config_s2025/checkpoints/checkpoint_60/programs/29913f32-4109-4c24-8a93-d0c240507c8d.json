Removes the redundant `best_xy` intermediate variable by directly unpacking the random values into `best_x` and `best_y`\n2. Removes duplicate/ unnecessary comments while keeping helpful explanatory comments\n3. Maintains the exact same algorithmic behavior and performance characteristics\n4. Creates more concise code that's easier to follow\n\nThe simplified code is more direct while preserving all the original functionality and performance metrics. The random search algorithm remains unchanged in its operation, but the code is now cleaner and easier to maintain."]}}}
