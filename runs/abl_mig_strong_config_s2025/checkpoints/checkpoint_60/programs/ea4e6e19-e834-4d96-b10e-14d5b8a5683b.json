Replace `bounds[0], bounds[1]` with tuple unpacking `*bounds` to make the code more concise and readable\n2. Improve comment clarity by specifying \"within bounds\" instead of the vague \"(simplified)\"\n3. Maintain the same functionality while making the code more maintainable - if the bounds parameter format ever changes, we only need to modify it in one place\n\nThe tuple unpacking `*bounds` is a more Pythonic approach that clearly shows we're using the bounds tuple directly, making the code flow better while reducing redundancy. The comment improvements help new readers understand the purpose of each section more quickly."]}}}
