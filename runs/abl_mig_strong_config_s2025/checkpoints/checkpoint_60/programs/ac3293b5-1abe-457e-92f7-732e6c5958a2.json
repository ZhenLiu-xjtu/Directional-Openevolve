Combining separate random number generation calls into single calls that generate both coordinates at once\n2. Adding brief comments to clarify the purpose of these lines\n3. Reducing code duplication and improving readability\n\nThe algorithm remains functionally identical (still performing random search), but the code is more concise and maintainable. The use of numpy's ability to generate multiple random numbers in one call makes the code cleaner while maintaining the same performance characteristics.\n\nThese changes address the \"simplifying the code to improve readability and maintainability\" area for improvement while preserving all the existing positive performance metrics."]}}}
