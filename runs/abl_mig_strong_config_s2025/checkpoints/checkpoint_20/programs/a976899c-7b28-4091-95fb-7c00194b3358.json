Improve code readability by reducing lines of code\n2. May generate better-correlated coordinate pairs that explore the search space more effectively\n3. Revert to the approach used in Program 1 which had significantly better metrics (distance_score: 0.8706 vs current 0.5205, overall_score: 0.9849 vs current 0.2226)\n4. Maintain the same speed and reliability while potentially improving the optimization performance\n\nThe key insight is that generating coordinate pairs together rather than separately may lead to better exploration of the function landscape, helping the algorithm find better minima as shown in the performance metrics of earlier, more successful versions."]}}}
