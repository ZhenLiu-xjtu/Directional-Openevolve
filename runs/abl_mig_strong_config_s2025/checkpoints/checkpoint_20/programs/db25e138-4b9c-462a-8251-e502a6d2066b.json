Removing redundant comments that\u91cd\u590d explained the same code\n2. Using intermediate variables (`best_point` and `point`) to make the code flow more naturally\n3. Making the 2D point generation more explicit by separating the array creation from coordinate unpacking\n4. Simplifying comments to focus on \"what\" the code does rather than redundant \"how\" explanations\n\nThe functionality remains identical, but the code becomes easier to follow for human readers while maintaining the same performance metrics. The changes preserve the random search algorithm's behavior while making the code structure more intuitive."]}}}
