Removes the redundant `best_xy` intermediate variable by directly unpacking the random values into `best_x` and `best_y`\n2. Removes the redundant comment that restated what the code was doing\n3. Maintains the exact same functionality and performance characteristics\n4. Makes the code more concise while keeping it equally readable\n\nThe simplified code is easier to maintain because there are fewer variables to track and the initialization logic is more direct. This change doesn't affect any of the performance metrics since it's just a refactoring of existing logic."]}}}
