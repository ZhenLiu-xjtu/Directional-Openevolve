Start with more global exploration\n2. Gradually shift toward more local refinement (up to 80% local search in later iterations)\n3. Maintains the original performance strengths of speed and reliability\n\nThese changes should significantly improve distance_score by helping escape local minima and standard_deviation_score by making the algorithm more consistent across runs, while maintaining the program's simplicity and speed."]}}}
