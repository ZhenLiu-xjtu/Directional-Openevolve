Remove the unnecessary `min_bound, max_bound = bounds` assignment by directly using `bounds[0]` and `bounds[1]`\n2. Maintain the exact same functionality while reducing code complexity\n3. Improve readability by eliminating intermediate variables\n4. Make the code more concise while keeping the same performance characteristics\n\nThe simplified version is easier to maintain since there are fewer variables to track, and the code more directly expresses its intent.
