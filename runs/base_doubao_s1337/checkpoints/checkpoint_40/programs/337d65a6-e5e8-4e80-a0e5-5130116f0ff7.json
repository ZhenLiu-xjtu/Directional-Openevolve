Simplify Bounds Handling\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with random coordinates (simplified)\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n=======\n    # Initialize with random coordinates\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(*bounds, size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Simple random search (simplified)\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n=======\n        # Generate new random point\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(*bounds, size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:** Using `*bounds` to unpack the tuple is more Pythonic and readable than indexing with `bounds[0]` and `bounds[1]`. This simplifies the code while maintaining the same functionality. Removed redundant \"(simplified)\" comments that don't add value.\n\n## 2. Add Adaptive Search Strategy\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(*bounds, size=2)\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n\n        if value < best_value:\n=======\n        # Adaptive search: explore locally around best findings with decreasing step size\n        if np.random.random() < 0.3:  # 30% chance for local search\n            # Step size decreases over time to focus on promising areas\n            step_size = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * (1 - _/iterations) * 0.1\n            x = np.clip(best_x + np.random.normal(0, step_size), bounds[0], bounds[1])\n            y = np.clip(best_y + np.random.normal(0, step_size), bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        else:  # 70% chance for global exploration\n            x, y = np.random.uniform(*bounds, size=2)\n            \n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n        \n        # Accept new solution if better\n        if value < best_value:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:** This improvement maintains the algorithm's simplicity while adding an adaptive component that:\n1. Explores locally around promising solutions (30% of the time)\n2. Gradually reduces step size to focus on promising regions\n3. Keeps global exploration (70% of the time) to avoid getting stuck in local minima\n\nThis should improve the value_score and distance_score by finding better minima while maintaining good speed and reliability scores. The algorithm remains easy to understand and maintain."]}}}
