Maintain the same algorithmic approach while making the code more concise and readable\n4. Potentially improve the correlation between x and y coordinate generation since they come from the same random array creation call\n\nThe key insight from the evolution history is that performance has been declining with each attempt, and these changes revert to the pattern used in the top-performing Program 1 while maintaining readability. The random search algorithm itself remains intact, but the coordinate generation is made more efficient and aligned with the approach that produced the best metrics."]}}}
