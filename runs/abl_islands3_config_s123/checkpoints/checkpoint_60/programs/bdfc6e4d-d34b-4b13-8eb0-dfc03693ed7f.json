The key improvements are:\n\n1. **Hybrid Search Strategy**: Combines local exploration (30%) with global random search (70%) to balance exploitation of good solutions and exploration of new areas.\n\n2. **Intelligent Local Exploration**: When exploring locally, we generate points around the current best solution using a normal distribution scaled to 10% of the search space width. This focuses search effort where we've already found good solutions.\n\n3. **Boundary Enforcement**: The `np.clip()` ensures we stay within the search bounds even when exploring around the edges.\n\nThis approach should improve:\n- **value_score**: By more efficiently finding better minima through local exploration\n- **distance_score**: By focusing search around promising regions\n- **standard_deviation_score**: By consistently finding good solutions rather than relying purely on random chance\n- **combined_score**: Through the above improvements while maintaining perfect speed and reliability scores\n\nThe code remains readable with clear comments explaining the two search strategies, and the computational complexity remains O(iterations), preserving the perfect speed_score."]}}}
