Simplify Variable Names and Improve Comments\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize bounds and starting point\n    min_bound, max_bound = bounds\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(min_bound, max_bound, size=2)\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Simple random search\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(min_bound, max_bound, size=2)\n=======\n    # Initialize bounds and starting point\n    low, high = bounds\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(low, high, size=2)\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Generate random candidate point within bounds\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(low, high, size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n**Reasoning:** Changed `min_bound, max_bound` to the more concise `low, high` while maintaining clarity. Improved the loop comment to better describe what the code is doing. This makes the code slightly more readable without changing any functionality.\n\n### 2. Enhance Docstring with More Context\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple random search algorithm that often gets stuck in local minima.\n\n    Args:\n        iterations: Number of iterations to run\n        bounds: Bounds for the search space (min, max)\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (best_x, best_y, best_value)\n    \"\"\"\n=======\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple random search algorithm that explores the search space by generating random points.\n    \n    Note: This algorithm has a tendency to get stuck in local minima and may not find the global minimum\n    due to its purely random exploration strategy.\n\n    Args:\n        iterations: Number of iterations to run\n        bounds: Bounds for the search space (min, max)\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (best_x, best_y, best_value)\n    \"\"\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n**Reasoning:** Expanded the docstring to provide better context about the algorithm's approach and limitations. This improves maintainability by helping future developers understand both how and why the code works the way it does.\n\nThese changes maintain the exact same algorithmic behavior that produced the strong performance metrics while making the code more readable and maintainable. The core random search functionality remains identical, so we can expect similar performance results with improved code quality."]}}}
