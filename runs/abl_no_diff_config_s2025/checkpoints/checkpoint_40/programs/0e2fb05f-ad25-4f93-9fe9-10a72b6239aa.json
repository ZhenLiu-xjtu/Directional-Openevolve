Updated the docstring to remove the misleading \"often gets stuck in local minima\" comment that didn't reflect the strong performance metrics\n2. Removed redundant \"using combined coordinates\" comment that added no technical value\n3. Changed return statement to use explicit indexing (`best_point[0], best_point[1]`) instead of unpacking (`*best_point`) for improved readability\n4. Maintained all original functionality, inputs, and outputs while creating cleaner, more maintainable code\n\nThese changes focus on improving code clarity and maintainability as requested, while preserving the algorithm's performance that already scores well on all metrics."]}}}
