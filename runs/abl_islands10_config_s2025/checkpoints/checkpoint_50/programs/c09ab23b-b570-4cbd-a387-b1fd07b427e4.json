More Descriptive Variable Names\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Generate candidate point and evaluate\n    point = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n    value = evaluate_function(*point)\n\n    if value < best_value:\n        best_value = value\n        best_point = point\n=======\n    # Generate candidate point and evaluate\n    candidate_point = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n    candidate_value = evaluate_function(*candidate_point)\n\n    if candidate_value < best_value:\n        best_value = candidate_value\n        best_point = candidate_point\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\nThis makes the code flow more naturally when reading and clarifies the relationship between variables.\n\n## 2.

The algorithm's performance metrics should remain strong since we're not changing any core logic."]}}}
