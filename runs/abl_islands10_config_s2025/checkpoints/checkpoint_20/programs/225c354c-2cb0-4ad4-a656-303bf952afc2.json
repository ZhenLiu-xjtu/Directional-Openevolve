Optimize Initial Point Generation\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    best_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n=======\n    # Initialize with a random point using single random call\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n## 2. Optimize Candidate Point Generation\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Simple random search\n        x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n=======\n        # Generate candidate point with single random call\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n## Reasoning\n\nThe key difference between the current program and the top performers is how random points are generated. The current approach uses separate calls to `np.random.uniform` for x and y coordinates, while the top performers generate both coordinates in a single call.\n\nThis change:\n1. Reduces the number of random number generator calls by 50%\n2. Creates better coordinate pairings that likely explore the search space more effectively\n3. Maintains the same algorithmic complexity and speed characteristics\n4. Matches the pattern used in Program 1 and Program 2 which have significantly better distance_score (0.8746 vs 0.5205) and overall_score (0.9859 vs 0.2226)\n\nBy generating coordinate pairs together rather than independently, we maintain better spatial relationships in the search space, which should help the algorithm find better minima (improving distance_score) and produce more consistent results (improving standard_deviation_score).\n\nThese changes are minimal and focused, preserving the program's current strengths in speed and reliability while addressing the key areas for improvement."]}}}
