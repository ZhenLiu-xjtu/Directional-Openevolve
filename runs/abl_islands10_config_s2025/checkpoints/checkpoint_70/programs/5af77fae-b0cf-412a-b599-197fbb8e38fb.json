The docstring is simplified to focus on what the algorithm does rather than its limitations, making it more concise while maintaining all necessary information.\n\n2. The candidate solution generation is simplified by using a single `np.random.uniform` call with `size=2`, making the code more compact and consistent with the initialization pattern used for the initial best solution.\n\n3. Removed redundant comment (\"Simple random search\") that stated the obvious, while keeping a more descriptive comment about what the code actually does (\"Generate new candidate solution\").\n\nThese changes reduce cognitive load for future maintainers while preserving the algorithm's performance characteristics that are already scoring well on all metrics."]}}}
