Simplify Best Value Update\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value = value\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n=======\n        # Update best values in a single line when improvement found\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value, best_x, best_y = value, x, y\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis simplifies the update logic by combining the assignments into a single line, making the code more concise while maintaining the same functionality. This improves readability and reduces the chance of errors if variables need to be modified later.\n\n## 2. Simplify Initialization Comments\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with a random point using single random call\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Simple random search using single random call\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n=======\n    # Initialize with random point\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Generate candidate point\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThe comments are simplified to be more concise while still conveying the same information. This reduces redundancy in the code documentation without losing clarity, making the code easier to scan quickly.\n\nThese changes maintain the algorithm's core functionality and excellent speed/reliability metrics while improving code maintainability. The simplified structure may also slightly improve the standard_deviation_score by making the algorithm's behavior more consistent and less prone to implementation variations."]}}}
