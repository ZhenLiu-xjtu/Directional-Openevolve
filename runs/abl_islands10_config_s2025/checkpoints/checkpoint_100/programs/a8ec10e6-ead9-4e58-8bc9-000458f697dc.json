Simplify comments to be more concise while retaining essential information\n2. Combine the two separate random number generation calls in the loop into a single call that generates both coordinates at once\n\nThe combined random number generation is particularly beneficial as it:\n- Reduces code length while maintaining the same functionality\n- Improves readability by keeping related operations together\n- Maintains the same algorithmic behavior but with cleaner implementation\n- Matches the pattern used in Program 2 which had strong performance metrics\n\nThese changes directly address the \"simplify the code\" improvement area while maintaining the core algorithm that has already demonstrated strong performance across all metrics."]}}}
