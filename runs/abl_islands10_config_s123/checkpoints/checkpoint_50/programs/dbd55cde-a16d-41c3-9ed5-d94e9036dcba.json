Simplify Random Point Generation with Helper Function\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with random point\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(*bounds, size=2)\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Generate new random candidate point\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(*bounds, size=2)\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value = value\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n=======\n    def generate_candidate():\n        \"\"\"Generate a random candidate point within bounds\"\"\"\n        return np.random.uniform(*bounds, size=2)\n    \n    # Initialize with random point\n    best_point = generate_candidate()\n    best_x, best_y = best_point\n    best_value = evaluate_function(*best_point)\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Generate new random candidate point\n        candidate = generate_candidate()\n        x, y = candidate\n        value = evaluate_function(*candidate)\n\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value = value\n            best_point = candidate\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change:\n- Reduces code duplication by creating a helper function for candidate generation\n- Improves readability with a descriptive function name\n- Groups related variables using a \"point\" abstraction\n- Makes the code more maintainable if we ever need to change how candidates are generated\n\n## 2. Simplify Docstring Description\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple random search algorithm that often gets stuck in local minima.\n\n    Args:\n        iterations: Number of iterations to run\n        bounds: Bounds for the search space (min, max)\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (best_x, best_y, best_value)\n    \"\"\"\n=======\n    \"\"\"\n    Simple random search algorithm for function minimization.\n    \n    Generates random candidate points within specified bounds and keeps\n    track of the point with the minimum function value.\n\n    Args:\n        iterations: Number of iterations to run (default: 1000)\n        bounds: Bounds for the search space as (min, max) tuple (default: (-5, 5))\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (best_x, best_y, best_value) representing the minimum found\n    \"\"\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis documentation improvement:\n- Removes unnecessarily negative language (\"often gets stuck\")\n- Adds a brief explanation of how the algorithm works\n- Makes default parameter values explicit in the Args section\n- Clarifies what the return value represents\n\nThese changes maintain the original algorithm's performance while making the code more readable, maintainable, and self-documenting. The core random search functionality remains identical, so we can expect similar performance metrics while improving code quality."]}}}
