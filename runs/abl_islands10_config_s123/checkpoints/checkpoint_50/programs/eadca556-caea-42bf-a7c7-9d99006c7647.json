Simplified the initial comment that mentioned \"combined uniform sampling\" which wasn't necessary since we're just using standard uniform sampling\n\n2. Renamed `value` to `current_value` in the loop to make its purpose clearer\n\n3. Combined the three variable updates into a single line using tuple assignment, making the code more concise while maintaining readability\n\n4. Combined the comment lines to better group related operations\n\nThe algorithm's performance characteristics remain unchanged, but the code becomes easier to understand and maintain. These are targeted, minimal changes that address the specific area for improvement (simplification) without introducing new complexity."]}}}
