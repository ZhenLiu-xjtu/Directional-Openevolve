The `*bounds` syntax is more Pythonic and makes the code shorter without sacrificing clarity.\n\nSince the algorithm performance metrics are already excellent (all scores >0.9), these targeted simplifications focus on the identified improvement area (readability/maintainability) without risking any performance regressions."]}}}
