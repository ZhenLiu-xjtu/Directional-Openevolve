Improve readability by making the coordinate generation more compact\n4. Keep the same random distribution properties through NumPy's vectorized uniform sampling\n\nThe algorithm remains a pure random search but with cleaner, more maintainable code that's easier to follow. All performance metrics should remain identical since we're using the same random sampling approach, just with more concise syntax."]}}}
