This matches the approach used in the top-performing program which had higher value_score and combined_score.\n\n2. **Adaptive Local Search**: By adding a 20% chance of local exploration around the current best solution, we create a balance between global exploration (finding new regions) and local exploitation (refining promising solutions). The decreasing step size ensures we start with broader exploration and gradually focus on promising areas - this should help improve the value_score and distance_score by helping escape local minima while maintaining the speed and reliability metrics.\n\nThese changes are targeted, maintain the code's simplicity, and address the specific metrics showing regression (value_score, overall_score, and combined_score) while preserving the perfect scores for runs_successfully, speed_score, and reliability_score."]}}}
