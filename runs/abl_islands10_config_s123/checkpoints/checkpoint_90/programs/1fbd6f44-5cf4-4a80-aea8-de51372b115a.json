Removing unnecessary intermediate variables (`best_point` and `point`) that don't add clarity\n2. Combining array creation and unpacking into a single step\n3. Reducing overall lines of code while maintaining the same functionality\n\nThe simplified version is more readable because it eliminates redundant variables and makes the data flow more direct. This also improves maintainability by reducing the amount of code that needs to be understood and modified when making changes. The functionality remains identical as we're still generating the same random points and unpacking them into the same variables."]}}}
