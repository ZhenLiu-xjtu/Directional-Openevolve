Replace `*bounds` unpacking with explicit `bounds[0], bounds[1]` indexing, which correlates with better value_score in Program 2\n2. Simplify variable name from `current_value` to `value` for improved readability\n3. Split the tuple assignment in the update line to make the code flow more naturally\n\nThe changes maintain the algorithm's simplicity while adopting patterns from Program 2 which had a higher value_score (0.9692 vs current 0.9616). The explicit bounds indexing appears to help with value_score, while the simplified variable names and assignment improve readability as requested.\n\nThese modifications are conservative and focused on areas that showed clear correlation with better performance in the top-performing programs, while maintaining the perfect speed and reliability scores."]}}}
