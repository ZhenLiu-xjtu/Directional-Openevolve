Improves exploration by starting with multiple initial points (5 instead of 1)\n2. Maintains simplicity while making the initialization logic more robust\n3. Reduces the chance of getting stuck in poor local minima by starting with a broader exploration\n4. Adds clearer comments explaining the initialization strategy\n\nThe multiple initial points help the algorithm better sample the search space before beginning the iterative improvement process, which can lead to finding better solutions while maintaining the algorithm's simplicity and speed."]}}}
