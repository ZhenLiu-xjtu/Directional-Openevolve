This approach significantly improved value_score, distance_score, and overall_score in previous successful iterations.\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Accept better solutions or occasionally worse ones to escape local minima\n        if value < best_value or np.random.random() < 0.01:\n            best_value = value\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n\n=======\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value = value\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n            \n            # Local search around promising points\n            for _ in range(10):\n                # Small perturbations around the best found point\n                local_x = best_x + np.random.normal(0, 0.1)\n                local_y = best_y + np.random.normal(0, 0.1)\n                \n                # Keep within bounds\n                local_x = np.clip(local_x, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n                local_y = np.clip(local_y, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n                \n                local_value = evaluate_function(local_x, local_y)\n                if local_value < best_value:\n                    best_value = local_value\n                    best_x, best_y = local_x, local_y\n\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change:\n1. Removes the random acceptance of worse solutions (which was likely increasing standard deviation)\n2. Adds a local search refinement phase that explores around promising solutions\n3. Maintains the random search foundation while adding systematic local exploration\n4. Keeps solutions within bounds during local search\n\nThe local search helps refine promising solutions rather than just jumping randomly, which should:\n- Improve value_score by finding better minima\n- Improve distance_score by getting closer to the true minimum\n- Reduce standard_deviation_score by making the algorithm more consistent\n- Improve overall_score and combined_score through the above improvements\n\nThis approach worked extremely well in Program 1, which achieved value_score of 0.9973 and distance_score of 0.9553 - significantly better than the current program's metrics."]}}}
