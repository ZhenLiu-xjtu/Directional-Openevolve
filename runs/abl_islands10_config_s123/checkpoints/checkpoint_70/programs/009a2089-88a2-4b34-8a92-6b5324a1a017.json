Combining separate variable initializations into single lines using tuple unpacking\n2. Reducing repeated code by generating both coordinates in one `np.random.uniform` call\n3. Adding brief comments to clarify the intent of these operations\n\nThe functionality remains identical since we're still generating the same uniform random values for x and y coordinates. This makes the code more concise and readable while maintaining all the existing performance metrics (runs_successfully=1.0000, speed_score=1.0000, etc.).\n\nThe changes follow Python best practices for readability by:\n- Reducing boilerplate code\n- Grouping related variable assignments\n- Adding clarifying comments for non-obvious operations\n\nThis makes the code easier to maintain and modify in the future while preserving its current behavior and performance characteristics.\n```"]}}}
