The first two changes make the code more readable by using explicit `size=2` parameter in the numpy uniform calls, matching the style of the top-performing Program 1 which had better distance and standard deviation scores.\n\n2. The local search addition is a strategic enhancement that:\n   - Explores the neighborhood around promising points with small Gaussian perturbations\n   - Helps escape local minima by searching locally around good solutions\n   - Adds minimal computational overhead (only 10 extra evaluations per improvement found)\n   - Maintains the original random search foundation while adding directed exploration\n\nThese changes should improve both value_score (by finding better minima) and distance_score (by getting closer to the true minimum), while maintaining the program's excellent speed and reliability scores."]}}}
