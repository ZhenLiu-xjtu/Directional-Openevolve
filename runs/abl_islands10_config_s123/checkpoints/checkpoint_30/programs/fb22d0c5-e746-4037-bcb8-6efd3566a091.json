Simplified Iteration Logic\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Generate new random point using vectorized operation\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value = value\n            best_x, best_y = x, y\n=======\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Generate new random point\n        point = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n        value = evaluate_function(*point)\n\n        if value < best_value:\n            best_value = value\n            best_point = point\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nFurther improvements:\n- Maintains the single variable for coordinates throughout the loop\n- Removes redundant comments about \"vectorized operation\" which is self-evident\n- Creates a more consistent code pattern between initialization and iteration\n\n## 3.

The simplified structure reduces cognitive load when reading the code without sacrificing functionality or performance."]}}}
