The simplified comments maintain clarity while being more concise.\n\n### 2. Add Simple Local Search to Escape Local Minima\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Generate new random point using vectorized operation\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n=======\n        # Explore locally around best solution 10% of the time to escape local minima\n        if np.random.random() < 0.1:  # 10% chance for local search\n            # Small perturbation around best solution\n            x = best_x + np.random.normal(0, 0.5)\n            y = best_y + np.random.normal(0, 0.5)\n            x, y = np.clip(x, bounds[0], bounds[1]), np.clip(y, bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        else:\n            # Regular random search\n            x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\nThis improvement maintains the simplicity of random search while adding a small chance (10%) to explore the area around the current best solution. This helps escape local minima by:\n- Introducing directed exploration near promising solutions\n- Keeping the algorithm simple and fast\n- Maintaining the original random search behavior most of the time\n\nThese changes should improve the value_score and distance_score by helping find better minima while keeping the code readable and maintaining all the perfect scores (runs_successfully, speed_score, reliability_score)."]}}}
