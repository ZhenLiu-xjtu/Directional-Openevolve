The comments \"vectorized for conciseness\" were unnecessary because:\n\n1. The code itself is already clear and self-documenting\n2. The vectorization is minimal and apparent from the `size=2` parameter\n3. Redundant comments create maintenance overhead and clutter\n\nThese changes improve readability and maintainability without altering the algorithm's functionality or performance characteristics. The algorithm remains a simple random search with the same performance metrics but with cleaner, more focused code."]}}}
