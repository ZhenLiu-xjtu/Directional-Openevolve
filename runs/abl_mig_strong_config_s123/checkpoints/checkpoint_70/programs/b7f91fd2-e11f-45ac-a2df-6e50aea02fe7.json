Simplify variable initialization by combining random number generation\n2. Add named variables for bounds to improve code clarity\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    best_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n=======\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    lower, upper = bounds\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(lower, upper, size=2)\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n=======\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(lower, upper, size=2)\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThese changes:\n1. Create more readable `lower` and `upper` variables from the bounds tuple\n2. Combine separate random number generation calls into single lines using `size=2`\n3. Eliminate redundant code and improve consistency\n4. Maintain the exact same algorithm behavior while making the code more concise\n5. Improve readability by reducing index-based access (`bounds[0]` \u2192 `lower`)\n\nThe algorithm's performance characteristics remain identical, but the code becomes easier to understand and maintain. The use of tuple unpacking and combined random generation makes the code flow more naturally while reducing opportunities for errors."]}}}
