Improve comment clarity by removing redundant \"(simplified)\" notes while maintaining helpful context\n2. Add a simple hybrid search strategy that occasionally explores around the current best solution (local search) while mostly maintaining the original random search (global exploration)\n3. Keep the algorithm simple and efficient while potentially helping escape local minima\n\nThe local exploration (20% of iterations) uses a normal distribution centered on the current best solution with standard deviation based on the search space size, then clips values to stay within bounds. This should help refine promising solutions while maintaining global search capability."]}}}
