Kept only the essential explanatory comments.\n\n3. **Consolidated assignment**: Combined the three variable assignments in the update step into a single line, making the code more concise while maintaining readability.\n\n4. **Improved comment clarity**: Changed \"Simple random search\" to \"Generate new random point and evaluate\" to more precisely describe what that section does.\n\nThese changes make the code easier to understand for future maintainers while keeping the same algorithmic approach that's already performing well on all metrics. The core random search functionality remains identical, so the performance metrics should remain unchanged while improving maintainability."]}}}
