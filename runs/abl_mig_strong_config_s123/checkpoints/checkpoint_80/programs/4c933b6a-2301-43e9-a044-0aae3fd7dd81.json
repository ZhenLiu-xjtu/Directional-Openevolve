These changes simplify the code while potentially improving the random distribution properties of the search algorithm.\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    best_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n=======\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```python\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Simple random search\n        x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n=======\n        # Simple random search\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThese changes:\n1. Combine separate random number generation calls into single calls that generate both coordinates at once\n2. Maintain the same algorithmic approach while making the code more concise and readable\n3. Potentially improve the correlation properties between x and y coordinates since they come from the same random number generation call\n4. Reduce the number of function calls, slightly improving efficiency\n\nThe top-performing programs consistently use this pattern of generating both coordinates in a single numpy call, which appears to lead to better search performance as measured by the distance_score and standard_deviation_score metrics. This is likely because generating coordinates together maintains better statistical properties in the search space exploration."]}}}
