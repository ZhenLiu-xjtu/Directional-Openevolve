Optimize Random Initialization\n\nThe current program initializes x and y separately, while top-performing programs generate them together. This change should improve the distance and value scores.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    best_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n=======\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    best_x, best_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n    best_value = evaluate_function(best_x, best_y)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n## 2. Optimize Candidate Solution Generation\n\nSimilarly, generating candidate solutions as a pair rather than separate values should improve search efficiency.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Simple random search\n        x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n=======\n        # Simple random search\n        x, y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=2)\n        value = evaluate_function(x, y)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n## Reasoning\n\nThese changes align our code with the top-performing programs (Program 1-3) which all use the combined random number generation approach. The key benefits are:\n\n1. **Improved correlation** between x and y values when exploring the search space\n2. **More efficient sampling** of the solution space\n3. **Reduced code complexity** with fewer lines of code\n4. **Maintained speed** since we're still using vectorized numpy operations\n\nThese modifications should help reverse the regression in value_score, distance_score, overall_score, standard_deviation_score, and combined_score while maintaining the perfect scores for runs_successfully, speed_score, reliability_score, and success_rate."]}}}
