The `size=2` parameter in `np.random.uniform` makes it obvious we're generating two coordinates, so the extra explanatory comments just add noise without providing additional value. This simplifies the code while maintaining its functionality and clarity.\n\nThe changes:\n1. Remove redundant \"Generate both coordinates in a single line\" comments\n2. Keep the higher-level explanatory comments (\"Initialize with a random point\" and \"Simple random search\") that provide context\n3. Maintain all functionality and performance characteristics\n\nThis makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain while preserving its excellent performance metrics."]}}}
