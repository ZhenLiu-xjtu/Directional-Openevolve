Simplified the code by using a single `best_point` array instead of separate x/y variables, reducing cognitive load\n2. Removed unnecessary unpacking of bounds into min/max variables\n3. Streamlined variable names for consistency (`current_point` instead of mixed naming)\n4. Maintained the same high-performance random search approach that was working well\n5. Kept the same function signature and return format for compatibility\n\nThese changes make the code more concise while preserving the core algorithm that was already performing well across all metrics. The simplified structure with consistent naming makes the code easier to understand and modify in the future."]}}}
