Removing intermediate variables (`best_point` and `point`) that don't add clarity\n2. Combining the best solution update into a single line, making the code more concise\n3. Updating comments to better describe the algorithm's intent rather than just the mechanics\n4. Reducing unnecessary variable assignments and unpacking operations\n\nThe simplified version maintains identical functionality and performance characteristics while being more readable and maintainable. The random search algorithm remains unchanged in behavior, but the code is now cleaner and easier to understand at a glance."]}}}
