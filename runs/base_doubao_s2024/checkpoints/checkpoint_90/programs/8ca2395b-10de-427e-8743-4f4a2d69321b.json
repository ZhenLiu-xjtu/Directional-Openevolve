Simplify the code by replacing two separate random number generation calls with a single vectorized call that generates both coordinates at once\n2. Improve readability by making the code more concise while maintaining clarity\n3. Maintain the same functionality but with fewer lines of code\n4. Align with the vectorized approach used in the top-performing Program 1 which had better distance and overall scores\n\nThe vectorized approach is more idiomatic numpy and reduces code duplication, making the code easier to maintain while preserving the random search algorithm's core functionality."]}}}
