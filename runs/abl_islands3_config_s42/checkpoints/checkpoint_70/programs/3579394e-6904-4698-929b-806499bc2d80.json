Remove unnecessary intermediate `best_point` and `point` variables that were introduced in later iterations\n2. Simplify the code by directly unpacking the random values into x/y variables\n3. Revert to the approach used in Program 1 which had significantly better metrics (value_score: 0.9898 vs current 0.9621, distance_score: 0.9104 vs current 0.8591)\n4. Maintain the same functionality while making the code more straightforward and readable\n5. Eliminate the need for tuple unpacking with `*point` syntax, making the code more explicit\n\nBy removing these layers of indirection, we simplify the code while potentially restoring the performance metrics that have been declining in recent iterations."]}}}
