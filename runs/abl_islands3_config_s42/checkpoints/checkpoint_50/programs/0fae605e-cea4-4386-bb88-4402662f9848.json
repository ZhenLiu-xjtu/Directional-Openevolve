Restore the explicit `size=2` parameter in numpy's uniform random number generation, which was used in the top-performing Program 1\n2.

Improve initialization comment clarity with \"a random point\" instead of \"random point\"\n\nThe explicit `size=2` parameter makes the code more readable and maintainable by clearly indicating we want a 2-dimensional output. This matches the syntax used in Program 1, which had significantly better metrics (distance_score: 0.9104 vs current 0.8726, standard_deviation_score: 0.9318 vs current 0.9024, and combined_score: 0.9514 vs current 0.9276).\n\nThese subtle changes maintain the algorithm's simplicity while potentially recovering the performance metrics that have regressed in recent iterations."]}}}
