The key improvements are:\n\n1. Added `num_starts` parameter to try multiple initial points\n2. Created multiple candidate starting points and selected the best one initially\n3. Updated documentation to reflect the improved algorithm capabilities\n\nThe multi-start approach helps address the regressed metrics by:\n- Improving distance_score: By sampling multiple starting points, we're more likely to find the global minimum instead of getting stuck in local minima\n- Improving standard_deviation_score: The algorithm will produce more consistent results across different runs\n- Improving overall and combined scores: These metrics aggregate the positive effects of the above improvements\n\nThe change maintains simplicity while adding valuable functionality that was present in the top-performing previous versions but appears to have been lost in the current implementation. The core random search loop remains unchanged, preserving speed and reliability scores that are already performing well."]}}}
