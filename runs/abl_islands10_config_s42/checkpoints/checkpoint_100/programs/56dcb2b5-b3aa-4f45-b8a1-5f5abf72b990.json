Simplified the `np.random.uniform` calls by using tuple unpacking with `*bounds` instead of explicit indexing\n2. Renamed `value` to `current_value` for better clarity about what this variable represents\n3. Combined the three assignment lines in the improvement check into a single line, making the code more concise\n4. Updated comments to be more direct and descriptive while maintaining their explanatory value\n5. Maintained the same algorithmic behavior and performance characteristics\n\nThese changes make the code slightly more compact while improving readability through better variable names and more direct comments. The core random search functionality remains identical, so we can expect the performance metrics to stay consistent while the code becomes easier to maintain."]}}}
