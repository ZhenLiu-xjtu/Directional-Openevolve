This should help:\n   - Improve distance_score by refining solutions near good areas\n   - Maintain diversity through continued random search\n   - Keep standard_deviation low by not getting stuck in local minima\n   - Maintain speed_score with minimal additional computation\n\n2. **Readability**: The comment improvement makes the code slightly clearer without any performance impact, addressing the maintainability concern while keeping the code simple.\n\nThese changes are targeted, maintain the original algorithm's simplicity and speed, and should provide incremental improvements to the metrics showing potential for growth."]}}}
