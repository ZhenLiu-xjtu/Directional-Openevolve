Reduce code duplication by generating both coordinates in a single NumPy call\n2. Improve readability by making the coordinate pairing more explicit\n3. Maintain identical functionality and performance characteristics\n4. Simplify maintenance by having coordinate generation logic in one place\n\nThe algorithm remains a random search but with cleaner, more concise code that's easier to understand and modify. The use of `size=2` clearly indicates we're generating a pair of coordinates, and unpacking them into x/y variables maintains the original interface."]}}}
