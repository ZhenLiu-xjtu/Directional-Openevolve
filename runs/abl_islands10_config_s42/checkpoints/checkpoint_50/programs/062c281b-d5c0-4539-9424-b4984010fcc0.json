The original code had two identical comments explaining the initialization, which created unnecessary clutter. By keeping only the more descriptive comment, we make the code cleaner and easier to maintain without altering any of the algorithm's behavior or performance characteristics.\n\nThe rest of the code is already quite clean and maintainable. The algorithm itself is intentionally simple (random search), so significant structural changes would alter its fundamental nature rather than just improving readability. This targeted change addresses the maintainability concern while preserving the existing performance metrics."]}}}
